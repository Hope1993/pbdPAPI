##About##
pbdPAPI is an R package...

##Requirements##
* pbdPROF requires
  + R version 2.14.0 or higher.

##Notes##
Those with Intel Sandy Bridge and/or Intel Ivy Bridge architecutres should
be aware that flops counts are unreliable on these platforms.  This is
a problem with the hardware returning incorrect values, not with PAPI or
pbdPAPI.  For more details, ,see: 
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/wiki/PAPITopics:SandyFlops

pbdPAPI only supports serial applications.  For parallel codes, see
pbdPROF, and or consider using PAPI/TAU directly in your compiled code.  For
more details, see:  http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/wiki/Threads
