About
====================================================================
pbdPAPI is an R package which offers a set of R bindings for the Performance
Application Programming Interface (PAPI).

PAPI is a high-level C library for gathering information from hardware
performance counters.  PAPI measures events like cache misses, flops, etc.

For more information about PAPI, see the official website: 
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/PAPI/



Installation
====================================================================
pbdPROF requires R version 2.14.0 or higher.  It also requires the PAPI library,
but a distribution of PAPI v 5.3.0 is bundled with the package for those who
do not already have a system installation available.  For configuration options,
and installation instructions, see the package vignette.



Notes
====================================================================
Those with Intel Sandy Bridge and/or Intel Ivy Bridge architecutres should
be aware that flops counts are unreliable on these platforms.  This is
a problem with the hardware returning incorrect values, not with PAPI or
pbdPAPI.  For more details, see: 
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/wiki/PAPITopics:SandyFlops

pbdPAPI only supports serial applications.  For parallel codes, see
pbdPROF, and or consider using PAPI/TAU directly in your compiled code.  For
more details, see:  http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/wiki/Threads
