About
================================================================================
pbdPAPI is an R package which offers a set of R bindings for the Performance
Application Programming Interface (PAPI).  PAPI is a high-level C library for 
gathering information from hardware performance counters.  PAPI measures events 
like cache misses, flops, etc.

This allows for very powerful profiling of R code (compiled code via, for 
example, Rcpp, or even just plain old vanilla R), but with a very simple
interface.

For more information about PAPI, see the official website: 
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/PAPI/



Installation
================================================================================
pbdPAPI requires R version 2.14.0 or higher.  It also requires the PAPI library,
but a distribution of PAPI v 5.3.0 is bundled with the package for those who
do not already have a system installation available.  For configuration options,
and installation instructions, see the package vignette.

At this time, PAPI is only supported on Linux (and somewhat on FreeBSD). 
As such, pbdPAPI will only build and/or function on Linux.



Notes
================================================================================
Those with Intel Sandy Bridge and/or Intel Ivy Bridge architecutres should be 
aware that flops counts are unreliable on these platforms.  This is a problem 
with the hardware returning incorrect values, not with PAPI or pbdPAPI.  For 
more details, see: 
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/wiki/PAPITopics:SandyFlops

pbdPAPI only supports serial applications.  For parallel codes, see pbdPROF, and
or consider using PAPI/TAU directly in your compiled code.  For more details, 
see:  http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/wiki/Threads
